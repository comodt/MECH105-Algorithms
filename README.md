# Linear Algebra Algorithms
This is the LU factorization algorithm that I created with Gaussian elimination

**Inputs**
*A - coefficient matrix (number of rows must equal number of columns)

**Outputs** 
-L : lower triangular matrix, with 1's along diagonals
-U : upper triangular matrix
-P : pivot matrix

*Remember*, a correctly solve LU factorization solves for the problem **P * A = L * U**, which is a good check to make sure your solution is correct
