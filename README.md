# Linear Algebra Algorithm
This is the LU factorization algorithm that I created which implements Gaussian elimination

**Inputs**
1. A - coefficient matrix (number of rows must equal number of columns)

**Outputs** 
1. L (lower triangular matrix, with 1's along diagonals)
2. U (upper triangular matrix)
3. P (pivot matrix)

*Remember*, a correctly solve LU factorization solves for the problem **P * A = L * U**, which is a good check to make sure your solution is correct

I must note that I only got 70% on Matlab Grader for this assignment. Therefore, this code won't work for all matricies.

This path includes code for the algorithm and code to test the algorithm
